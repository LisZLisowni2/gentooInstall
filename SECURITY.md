## Reporting a Vulnerability

Since I’m the only contributor (at this moment), please feel free to report any vulnerabilities directly to me via GitHub issues or by sending me an email at [rafalkozikowski735@gmail.com].

1. How to Report:
- Please create a new Issue in this repository with the label "security" if you identify a vulnerability.
- Alternatively, you can email me directly at [rafalkozikowski735@gmail.com].
2. What to Expect:
- I’ll acknowledge your report within 24-48 hours.
- If the vulnerability is confirmed, I will prioritize fixing it and push a patch as soon as possible, usually within 1-3 days for critical issues.
-You’ll receive updates as I work on the fix.
3. Responsible Disclosure:
- Please avoid disclosing any vulnerabilities publicly until a fix has been released to avoid exposing other users to unpatched issues.
